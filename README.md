# cloudcreativity/utils-collection

Our standard collection class for handling lists in PHP. By lists, we mean
numerically indexed arrays.

This package also contains our `StandardIteratorInterface`. We use this if we
are writing specific collection classes that hold only particular types of
objects.

## Collection

The `CloudCreativity\Utils\Collection\Collection` is a standard class for

* `add`
* `addStrict`
* `addObjects`
* `clear`
* `insertAt`
* `pop`
* `push`
* `pushObjects`
* `remove`
* `removeAt`
* `removeStrict`
* `replace`
* `shift`
* `unshift`
* `unshiftObjects`

### Accessors

The following methods give access to items within the collection:

* `first`
* `itemAt`

### Querying

The following methods can be used to assess or query the contents of the
collection;

### Helpers

The following methods assist with handling the list, and return new instances
